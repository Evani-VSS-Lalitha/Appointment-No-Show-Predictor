### ✅ `README.md`

```markdown
# 🩺 Appointment No-Show Predictor

This project predicts which patients are likely to **miss their appointments** and recommends **intervention strategies** (like SMS reminders or cab offers) to improve attendance.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Healthcare systems lose time and resources due to patient no-shows. This system uses **machine learning** to analyze appointment data and predict risk levels, enabling clinics to take proactive steps.

---

## 💡 Features

- 📊 Predicts **no-show probability** for each appointment
- 🧠 Built with **Random Forest Classifier**
- 📈 Suggests **personalized interventions**:
  - SMS reminders
  - Cab service offers
- 🌐 User-friendly **Streamlit frontend**
- 📥 Upload your own CSV data
- 📤 Download predictions and interventions as CSV
